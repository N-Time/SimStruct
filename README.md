# SimStruct

SimStruct is a framework of performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) with elaborated engineering demand parameters (EDPs) for a complecated structure system, such as a high-speed railway bridge (HSRB). Currently, several EDP function is provided:

1) fIAD.m: A simple and imformative matrix-based EDP is proposed for the interlayer damage in longitudinally continuous ballastless track;
2) fedpSEDM.m: A conventional and scalar EDP is proposed for discontinuous connections in HSRB.
